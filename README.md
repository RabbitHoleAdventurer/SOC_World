<h2> 📝 What is a SOC?  📝 </h2>
<h5>
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team within an organization that is responsible for monitoring and managing security-related issues. The primary goal of a SOC is to detect, analyze, respond, and mitigate cybersecurity threats in real-time. SOC teams use a combination of tools to triage alerts and make informed decisions.

<h2> 📝What are SID's and why are they important 📝</h2>
A security identifier is a unique alphanumeric identifier for a security principal or security group.
A security principal can be anything from a user account, a computer account, or a thread or process that runs in the security context of a user/computer account.

Every user, group, or task on a computer gets a special ID, called a SID. This SID is generated by an authority system such as a Domain Controller.
The computer keeps a list of these IDs to make sure everything is safe and secure.

Each time a user signs in, the system creates an access token for that user. The access token contains the user's SID, user rights, and the SIDs for any groups the user belongs to.

There are some SID's that identify generic groups and users. A few examples are the Everyone group and the SYSTEM user.

Everyone Group: S-1-1-0

SYSTEM: S-1-5-18

<br /><br />
The components of a SID are easier to visualize when SIDs are converted from a binary to a string format by using standard notation:

***S-R-X-Y1-Y2-Yn-1-Yn***
<br /><br />

Example: S-1-5-21-1574559362-3190734025-665073282-100269

SID Breakdown:

A revision level (1)

An identifier authority (5, NT Authority)

A domain identifier (21-1574559362-3190734025-665073282, Domain)

A relative identifier (100269)

<h4>Launch Daemon and Launch Agents</h4>



Launch Agents/Daemons are often installed to perform updates to programs, launch user specified programs at login, or to conduct other developer tasks.

Launch Agents/Daemons behavior is stored in a plist file used to interact with Launchd (the service management framework) used by macOS.

Launch Daemons require elevated privileges to install, are executed for every user on a system prior to login and run in the background without the need for user interaction.



 <br />

<h4>Required Launch Daemons parameters include</h4>


  Label to identify the task

  Path to the executable

  RunAtLoad to specify when the task is run (set to true to run at Startup)

 
<br />


Biggest difference between launch daemons and launch agents are that:
Daemons execute tasks at the system-level

Agents execute tasks within the context of the user’s interactive session

<h3>MacOS Best Practices</h3>

Enabling Gatekeeper, Configuring System Integrity Protection (SIP), Enabling Auto Update, Disabling Screen Sharing


<br />
<h4>Enabling Gatekeeper</h4>


This feature protects the machine from launching unknowingly malicious applications.

This is done by enforcing code signing and limiting the sources that applications can be downloaded from.


<br /><br />


<h4>Configuring System Integrity Protection (SIP)</h4>


This feature provides:

Protection to the entire system by preventing the execution of unauthorized code. 

For example, protection for system files and directories, code injection protection, runtime attachments protection, protection against unsigned kernel extensions.

Reduces the chance of a Mac being subject to malicious runtime attachments.



<br /><br />

<h4> What is a Plist file? Why are they important? </h4>


Plist stands for property list 

Used to store application preferences, in essence this is the configuration information for an application.

The behavior of a daemon/agent is specified in this property file usually written in XML
