<h2> 📝 What is a SOC?  📝 </h2>
<h5>
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team within an organization that is responsible for monitoring and managing security-related issues. The primary goal of a SOC is to detect, analyze, respond, and mitigate cybersecurity threats in real-time. SOC teams use a combination of tools to triage alerts and make informed decisions.

<h2> 📝What are SID's and why are they important 📝</h2>
A security identifier is a unique alphanumeric identifier for a security principal or security group.
A security principal can be anything from a user account, a computer account, or a thread or process that runs in the security context of a user/computer account.

Every user, group, or task on a computer gets a special ID, called a SID. This SID is generated by an authority system such as a Domain Controller.
The computer keeps a list of these IDs to make sure everything is safe and secure.

Each time a user signs in, the system creates an access token for that user. The access token contains the user's SID, user rights, and the SIDs for any groups the user belongs to.

There are some SID's that identify generic groups and users. A few examples are the Everyone group and the SYSTEM user.

Everyone Group: S-1-1-0

SYSTEM: S-1-5-18

<br /><br />
The components of a SID are easier to visualize when SIDs are converted from a binary to a string format by using standard notation:

***S-R-X-Y1-Y2-Yn-1-Yn***
<br /><br />

Example: S-1-5-21-1574559362-3190734025-665073282-100269

SID Breakdown:

A revision level (1)

An identifier authority (5, NT Authority)

A domain identifier (21-1574559362-3190734025-665073282, Domain)

A relative identifier (100269)

<h2> 📝 Processes and Process Trees 📝</h2>
Processes on a computer show us what programs and binaries are running which helps us understand if there are nefarious things happening in our systems. 
<br /><br />
Process trees allow us to further add context into the commands that we observe running on the systems we analyze.
<br /><br />
With the relationship context, this allow us to make better informed decisions on what action to take during our investigations.
<br /><br />
There are times when a command looks suspicious but understanding the parent or grandparent relationship helps us know if this command should be running on our system or if it needs to be stopped and investigated.
<br /><br />
It is also much easier to find malicious activity by using process trees as when malicious activity is identified, we can look at the parent process and see what else spawned from that same parent. Allowing us to find other malicious activity quickly.

<h4>Launch Daemon and Launch Agents</h4>



Launch Agents/Daemons are often installed to perform updates to programs, launch user specified programs at login, or to conduct other developer tasks.

Launch Agents/Daemons behavior is stored in a plist file used to interact with Launchd (the service management framework) used by macOS.

Launch Daemons require elevated privileges to install, are executed for every user on a system prior to login and run in the background without the need for user interaction.



 <br />

<h4>Required Launch Daemons parameters include</h4>


  Label to identify the task

  Path to the executable

  RunAtLoad to specify when the task is run (set to true to run at Startup)

 
<br />


Biggest difference between launch daemons and launch agents are that:
Daemons execute tasks at the system-level

Agents execute tasks within the context of the user’s interactive session

<h2> 📝 DNS Logs 📝</h2>
The Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the Internet's contact list. When individuals browse the web, they use domain names such as google.com or amazon.com. However, web browsers communicate using Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Yes, browsers use the IP protocol, the set of numbers that humans would never care to remember (x.x.x.x). DNS bridges this gap by translating domain names into IP addresses, enabling browsers to access online resources. Beyond facilitating web browsing, DNS is crucial for various network software, including malware, as it resolves domains to IP addresses before establishing connections over protocols like HTTP(S) and SMTP, among other protocols. As a result, DNS logging provides a comprehensive record of domain accessed by endpoints in the network environment, extending beyond just HTTP(S) traffic. This makes DNS logs a valuable resource for defenders seeking insights into network activity.
<br /><br />

Key things to look for on DNS logs:
Top Level Domains not widely used in the organization
Inbound and Outbound requests for top level domains for countries outside of where an organization does business
Domains with short TTLs as these domains may be being used by attackers that are associating multiple IP addresses with one domain (DNS fast flux)
Newly registered domains

<h2>📝 MacOS 📝</h2>
<h3>MacOS Best Practices</h3>

Enabling Gatekeeper, Configuring System Integrity Protection (SIP), Enabling Auto Update, Disabling Screen Sharing


<br />
<h4>Enabling Gatekeeper</h4>


This feature protects the machine from launching unknowingly malicious applications.

This is done by enforcing code signing and limiting the sources that applications can be downloaded from.


<br /><br />


<h4>Configuring System Integrity Protection (SIP)</h4>


This feature provides:

Protection to the entire system by preventing the execution of unauthorized code. 

For example, protection for system files and directories, code injection protection, runtime attachments protection, protection against unsigned kernel extensions.

Reduces the chance of a Mac being subject to malicious runtime attachments.



<br /><br />

<h4> What is a Plist file? Why are they important? </h4>


Plist stands for property list 

Used to store application preferences, in essence this is the configuration information for an application.

The behavior of a daemon/agent is specified in this property file usually written in XML
